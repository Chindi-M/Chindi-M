## 🌍 About Me

I'm a Cloud Platform & DevSecOps Engineer passionate about automation, security, and building resilient cloud-native infrastructure. I specialise in designing systems that are **scalable, observable, repeatable, and secure by default**.

I love turning complex cloud challenges into elegant, automated solutions ranging from Kubernetes platforms to fully codified cloud environments with Terraform and GitOps. My focus is on **developer experience, reliability, and operational excellence**.

**Dream it. Build it. Ship it. Automate it.**

Always open to collaborating on modern infrastructure, internal developer platforms, cloud automation and security engineering projects. If you're building something ambitious, let’s connect.
